<b>Abstract.</b> 
The event camera utility library contains python methods for focus optimisation, deep learning, event-stream noise augmentation, data format conversion and efficient generation of various event representations (event images, voxel grids etc).
Code is implemented using both numpy and pytorch, so that almost all functionality uses high performance vectorisation and array broadcasting.
Pytorch support means that it is very easy to run the library methods on GPU.
