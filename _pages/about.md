I am a PhD candidate at Monash University, Australia, advised by [Prof. Lindsay Kleeman](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=Q590I6YAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Tom Drummond](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=6sWGL5wAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focuses on event based vision where I have worked on optic flow and motion segmentation from events. More recently I have worked on optic flow and image reconstruction using deep neural networks. [Event based cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) are novel, bio-inspired visual sensors - much like the receptor cells in your cornea, pixels in an event camera operate asynchronously and independently. They do this by sending spatiotemporal information whenever a pixel detects a change in brightness. This has several benefits when compared to conventional cameras, such as ultra-low latency, high dynamic range and no motion-blur.

## Chronology
Chronology
======
I completed school at Golden Bay High School in Takaka, New Zealand with a an overall Excellence L3 endorsement in 2011.

In 2012 I moved to Germany where I completed a B.Sc. in Systems Engineering majoring in robotics at the University of Bremen in June 2015.

After taking a break to travel in Europe, South America and Indonesia I started my PhD at Monash in April 2017. From June 2018 to December 2018 I joined the <a href="http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/" target="_blank">Robotics and Perception Group</a> at the University of Zurich/ETH Zurich under [Davide Scaramuzza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SC9wV2kAAAAJ&hl=en), where I worked closely with [Guillermo Gallego](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v0_XxF0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am currently working on my thesis in anticipation of graduating in early 2021 after a planned internship at FRL in Seattle.
